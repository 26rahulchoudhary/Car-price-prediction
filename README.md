# 🚗 Car Price Prediction

This project explores and predicts car prices based on various attributes using data analysis and machine learning techniques. It focuses on understanding the statistical properties of car features and building predictive models to estimate car prices with high accuracy.

## 📌 Project Objectives

* Analyze patterns and distributions in car features (e.g., engine size, weight, bore ratio)
* Identify outliers and anomalies in the dataset
* Use regression models to predict car prices
* Compare model performance using evaluation metrics like R² score

## 📊 Dataset Overview

* **Total Entries:** 205 cars
* **Features Include:**

  * Technical specifications: `enginesize`, `curbweight`, `carwidth`, `stroke`, `boreratio`
  * Market-related data: `price`, `symboling`, `fueltype`, etc.
* **Price Range:**

  * Minimum: \$5,118
  * Maximum: \$45,400
  * Average: \$13,276

## 📈 Insights from Data

* 🚗 **Car Variety:** High variation in size, weight, and engine specifications
* 🛠️ **Engine Diversity:** Engines differ significantly in bore and stroke dimensions
* 📊 **Distribution:** Features like `compressionratio` and `horsepower` show outliers
* 🔍 **Symboling (risk rating):** Ranges from -2 to 3, indicating different risk levels

## 🤖 Machine Learning Approach

* **Train-Test Split:** 80-20
* **Model Used:** Linear Regression
* **Performance Metric:**

  * R² Score: **86.1%**

## 🏆 Results

* **Best Performing Model:**

  * ✔️ **Linear Regression** with an R² score of **86.1%**
* Simple yet powerful model for numerical prediction based on continuous variables.

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries Used

* **Python**, **Pandas**, **NumPy** – for data manipulation
* **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** – for visualization
* **Scikit-learn** – for model building and evaluation
